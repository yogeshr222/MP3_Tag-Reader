# MP3_Tag-Reader
The MP3 Tag Reader Project is a C-based utility that reads and displays metadata (ID3 tags) embedded in MP3 files. It extracts details like title, artist, album, year, and genre by parsing the ID3 header and frames, helping users view and verify song information directly from audio files.
